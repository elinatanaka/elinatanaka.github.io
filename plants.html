        <h3>Basic Planting Steps</h3>
        <p> decide what you want to grow and where
            outdoor plant? look up your zone by zipcode for what plants are recommended to grow. keep an eye on your
            outdoor space throughout the day and see where the light hits the longest and what remains shady. Most
            plants will have information about what their light requirements are, which will determine what place is
            best.
        </p>
        <p>
            indoor plant? how much natural light you get is very important for what plants you get for your home, and
            can be modified if you are willing to invest in grow lights and other plant setups. other things to observe
            are your humidity levels, air flow, and average temperature.
        </p>
        <p>
            research the plant!
            <ul>

                    light requirements<br>
                    “full sun” plants are typically best outdoors unless you have a very good indoor light situation.
                    indirect light usually means by a window or a sunny spot in the room. “full shade” is usually fine
                    in average rooms with no prolonged beam of light, but only a few plants will get away with no light
                    at all. if there are no windows, grow lights are recommended.

                <li>
                    soil requirements<br> usually plants will have recommended soil types in descriptions. if you have
                    regular potting soil and your
                    plant calls for something specific like acidity, loaminess, or high drainage, you can add amendments
                    to your
                    soil to help the plant

                <li>
                    watering preference<br>
                    some plants require constantly wet soil (i.e. carnivorous plants that grow in bog environments)
                    while others
                    thrive on dry environments and neglect. most just need a thorough watering ever week or so.
                    for indoor houseplants, i recommend having a pot with good drainage holes at the bottom and adding
                    water at
                    the bottom for the pot to suck up. if there is water still at the bottom after a while, it is excess
                    water
                    and can be used for another plant. this ensures that you’re not overwatering the plant, and the top
                    won’t be
                    too wet and invite pests or mold

        <h3>Soil Alternatives</h3>
        <p>if you’re worried about over/under watering, root rot, have pest problems like fungus gnats, etc, you might
            be interested in experimenting with semi-hydroponic planting.</p>
        <p>LECA (dry clay balls) and Lechuza Pon (mineral stones) are examples of soil replacements when you need an
            aerated or PH controlled environment for your plants. </p>
        <p>Only drawback is you need to occasionally rinse (atleast for LECA) and fertilize the plants so cannot be
            fully neglected. I prefer keeping them in glass jars to have an eye on water level and root systems.</p>
