        <h3>The Environment</h3>
        <p>Buns will have active hours and resting hours. Because they're prey animals, they're less likely to have the deepest sleep but usually rest mid-day and in the dead of night. In the early morning and the early evening, usually 5 for both, is when they'll be the hungriest and most active. Preferably, if a full free-range habitat is unavailable, this would be the hours that you would provide
            them ample space to run, jump, hop, binkie, and what have you.</p>
            <p>For their main habitat, there are nonnegotiables such as:
                <ul>
                    <li>Litter box</li>
                    <li>Water</li>
                    <li>Hay (I got a combo hay feeder/litter box from Etsy)</li>
                    <li>Hiding spot (I have cardboard boxes they can chew on and a carrier with towels inside)</li>
                </ul>
        </p>

        <p>I will always look up online with search terms "bunny" instead of "rabbit" so I don't accidentally get recipes or hunting content.</p>
        <h3>Diet</h3>
        <p>Rabbits should always be eating and pooping. Fresh hay, water, and a litter box should always be made available for the growing bun. If the bun doesn't poop in 24 hrs, it means a trip to urgent care (GI stasis). If the bun isn't eating throughout the day, it could mean that they might not be pooping, and tha means a trip to urgent care. Bun poop is essential.</p>
        <p>Recommended diet for young ones under a year, diet of mostly hay supplemented with pellets and fresh produce. Preferred brand has been Oxbow Essentials Young Rabbit Food as it doesn't contain sugary fillers (like dried fruits, nuts, and seeds). Hay is a blend of Timothy, Alfalfa, Oat, and Meadow Grass hay.</p>
        <p>Once older, I cut out Alfalfa hay and changed Oxbow Essentials from Young Rabbit to Adult</p>
        <p>produce options</p>
        <ul>
            <li>leafy greens</li>
            <li>small amounts of fruits</li>
            <li>herbs</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Grooming</h3>
        <p>Most rabbits are fastidious in nature and will self-groom. As long as the litter area is kept tidy and water sources made available, the buns will fend for themselves. Fur and nails usually require extra assistance, but if brown staining around the bottom or other similar mess it could indicate an underlying health issue. </p>
        <p>With every season comes the shedding.</p>
        <p>There are two ways the buns will shed; one with a full body moulting, and one that is more subtle. As an owner of a dwarf hotot, I am only family with the latter. Large tufts of fur will loosen gradually in the direction of head to tail. During that time I will brush fur constantly and gently pull the tufts out in grooming sessions that end up with fist-fized piles of fur. They love it.</p>
